# PskRedir
# Personal Socket Redirection Service
#
######################################################

This is a small daemon that redirect data from a network socket
to another configured address.
It can be roughly compared to a lightweight NAT service.

# History
##
The application was created to solve a specific problem in our environment:

The host (A) did not have any internet access because it was on a
isolated test network, thus could not reach the Internet Proxy Server (B).
Eventually the (A) machine had a need to connect to an update site
in order to download some packages.

That's when the PskRedir was created. It allowed a simple Windows workstation
(which had access to both networks) to act as a "proxy to proxy", and
the machine (A) could successfully reach the internet proxy.


[A] <-------> [Workstation with PskRedir] <-------> [B = Internet Proxy]

(Forwards data between A and B simulating a direct connection)

# How to use
##
Too simple!

Just copy the executable to any directory, and create a configuration file
pskredir.conf containing a line with the following information

0.0.0.0 LISTEN_PORT fwd_host FWD_PORT

Where:
0.0.0.0 = The interface on which the application listens for connections.
          Currently only the 0.0.0.0 (All interfaces) is supported.
LISTEN_PORT = The port where clients will connect.

fwd_host and FWD_PORT = Where the connection should be forwarded to.

Start the executable and it will wait for client connections.
When they connect, PskRedir itself opens a connection to the Forward
Host and starts exchanging packages between both nodes.


######################################################
# Limitations
##
PskRedir has some limitations:
- Supports ONE single client connection.
- Is not optimized for best performance. The transmission "from A to B"
  and "from B to A" happen in a single thread.

Given that, PskRedir is not a production-quality software.
Do not try to make services available to users through this software!

But it you need an ad-hoc quick and simple network redirection, this
could be the solution for you.
